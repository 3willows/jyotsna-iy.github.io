# Data and Society - DD

* Develop a deep sense of self + the role of technology
* Digital morphing of the body and the idea of the self
* automatic writing vs embodied writing
* automatic writing is the text produced by LLMs and can also also be unconscious/spiritual writing
* RE: Bettina Judd
* embodies writing as text that has been processed by language, muscular system before cognition
* Queer witcheries - glitchcraft
* AI written horoscope - Costar

Roopa Vasudevan and Audrey Desjardins session

* Relationships between new media artists and technology
* idea of power structures/dynamics
* Data double as a concept that has been bolstered by corporate, as a response to surveillance capitalism and as a form of pragmatics
* How is the self perceived by a machine?
* Browser data and data doubling (Data Portraits projects)
* Did people realise the value of their own data and do they view their data as a part of themself or of another self?
* Participants understood direct effects of browsing data, visualising as an important form of viewing data, materializing intangible data
* Reimagining factual data (from smart home devices) as fictional stories
* What is the bodily experience of the data double?
* Speculative fiction as a way to understand our own data
* Developing a heightened awareness to the surveillance gaze
* Rejecting seemingly "factual data" and transforming an objective device into a subjective one
* Keen to understand the in between, what the data doesn't capture
* How does collected data distort the in between, missing moments/phases of life?
* Non-neutral nature of data

Meghan Rim and MashinkaFirunts Hakopian

* Database fungibility
* Machine recognisable images/surveillance images
* consequences of facial recognition
* FRT harms BIPOC community
* How to create a diverse training dataset?
* Consent and body politics of FRT
* RE:The Phenomenology of Spirit by Hegel
* Master/Slave terminology used in tech
* Human in FRT is defined by whiteness
* training the violence of recognition through the mechanism of consent
* Database fungibility in the Indian context - extraction of surname/name and facial features (context: caste system)
* Data kinship as a concept
* What type of data is omitted in digital doubles?
* Ancestral Intelligence vs Artificial Intelligence
* Data as "truth"
* abuse of a body by an algorithm
* Datasets are built on real world stereotypes and are an act of violence
* Is training data in itself an important vector of harm?
* Rebuild a world without the stereotypes, without doubling the realities of society, can we use omission as a way to reclaim narratives about our data
* Lack of women researchers in teams that train datasets, conduct clinical trials
* Bioethics of data
* labour conditions of community generated data
* "Poisoning the data" (on purpose)

Roxanne Hoffman and Isadora Dullaert

* Digital identity - any system which involves identification, authentication, authorisation
* Privacy by design as a concept
* Ideology of blockchain/bitcoin has been libertarian roots
* Asymmetry of power in SSI (self sovereign identities)
* Bitcoin/Biometric systems/blockchains are more attractive in terms of set up and are being used instead of creating an infrastructure that is open and privacy preserving
* Self tracking through digital applications (quantified self)
* :RE: Cyborg Manifesto by Donna Haraway
* RE: Flat ontologies as a concept
* importance of data protection and data storage
* personal encoding (self tracking - reproduction related tech/apps)
* Low tech or no tech solutions as the most privacy preserving solutions
* police adjacent solutions to achieve justice
* (digital) wallet as a biopolitical identity in times of migration/crisis
* Homo mimic problem (self tracking)
* data mortality and possibility of data ghosts in the systems
