## Research Methodologies

Things to keep in mind:

* Hypothesis is empirically testable
* Replicability
* Objectivity - assumptions, concepts, procedures
* Transparency
* A hypothesis should be falsifiable
* Logical consistency
* Scientific research is chaotic and unpredictable (projects rarely follow a linear path)
* Projects might not resemble their initial research methods
* Scientific research can be exploratory

Types of research methods

* Qualitative and Quantitative
* Attitudinal and Behavioural
* Observational, experimental, simulation

There is data in all fields - social sciences, sciences, arts, design

Where does data come from? (lab, field, archive)

* Collecting data yourself
* Going out into the field - uncontrolled environment
* using existing data - secondary source
* combination of collecting your own data and existing data

Documentation

* Describing the original data
* Record metadata about the original data (irrespective of whether it is primary data or a secondary source)
* Describe the analysis of data
* Record the metadata about the analysis and data files
* Nature of questions in case of focus groups/real time studies
* Number of people
* Feedback
* Capture the (technical) difficulties
* What was the audience takeaway (Public Engagement Programmes)



## Writing Workshop

* RE: Joseph Williams on style

Why is writing important?

* Communication is a basic need
* Conveys your ideas effectively an informs your thinking
* indicates to the reader the care you have taken while producing that piece of scholarly work
* serves to get the reader to develop trust in the writer
* writing is not an innate skill

Creating an oasis for yourself in time and space is integral to write i.e taking into account planning/thinking, writing and rewriting

How to prepare?

* Thinking about the task at hand
* Think about the audience
* Do your research
* Think about your research/narrative
* RE: Dr. Uri Hasson's work
