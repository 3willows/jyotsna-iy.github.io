# Shannon Mattern - On Doubt

* Techno-determinism
* "Everything in tech is fixable by big tech"
* "quantum" "crypto" - hubrist thinking
* undoubtedly/without a doubt as a phrase - as an academic epistemological tool within research
* RE: Calling Bullshit: The Art of Skepticism in a Data-Driven World by Jevin D. West and Carl Bergstrom
* what academics consider causation within research
* cultivation of doubt disguised as a bad ideological practise
* a fascist opposition to critical race theory
* social constructivist theory as a tool of inquiry
* Priming the user with uncertainty/doubt - LLMs/Chatbots
* Chatbots are able to decode machine errors more easily i.e its own language
* coding humility - learning from data workers and those engaged in data labour
* speculative data infrastrcutures - zotero, omeka, press forward, sourcery
