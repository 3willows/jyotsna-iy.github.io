                <p>Did I mention that I am a fan of (non-numbered) lists?</p>
                <p>(Coming soon - an exhaustive resume for archival purposes)</p>
                <p>This is my <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jyotsna-iy/jyotsna-iy.github.io/main/CV - Jyotsna Iyer.pdf" target="_blank">CV (Professional)</a>.</p>
                <p>Though my academic training has been in Political Science, English Literature and Digital Humanities, my current work (Digital ID) utilizes fields like Science and Technology Studies (STS) and Sociology to analyze better ways to utilize digital technology for social welfare. Ultimately, I would like to work in and with organizations that improve or create public interest based digital technologies. As an independent researcher, my focus expands and draws from fields like forensic architecture, archival studies and literary studies to experiment with newer ways of approaching technology solutions and problems. This is an attempt at documenting the various engagements I have participated in over the years and it also serves as a canvas to reflect on my work in real time.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the internet breaks, leaks, and glitches. Thankfully the Wayback Machine and other resources make it easier to capture the ephemeral.</p>
