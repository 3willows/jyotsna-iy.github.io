        <p>My current research interests are broadly around digital identity systems, internet governance, platform economics and open-source software.<br> 
         I am drawing from information sciences, digital humanities, economics, political theory and anthropology to understand projects in my professional life.
            
         I am highly interested in roles and opportunities to experiment with arts, humanities and technology as an independent research outside of work, and for full-time roles I want to pursue projects that use the social sciences to inform technology/technology policy. I imbue 
         a lot of care and would like to work with organizations that believe in producing quality work.</p> 
         
        <p>Bio(s)

           St. Stephenâ€™s College, University of Delhi. She also has a Master of Science in Digital Humanities from University College London. Her research interests are interdisciplinary in nature, combining domains like computer science, science and technology studies, 
           political science, and philosophy.</p>
        
           always wishes she is by the sea. mostly studying about technology, politics and culture but thinking about language and literature. proponent of interdisciplinary studies and pushing oneself to play with dirt.</p>
