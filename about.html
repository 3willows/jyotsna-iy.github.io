                <p>My current research interests are broadly around digital identity systems, internet governance, platform economy, and open-source software.<br>
                I am highly interested in opportunities where I can experiment with the arts, humanities, and technology studies as an independent researcher outside of work. For full-time roles I want to pursue projects that use the social sciences to inform technology/technology policy.</p><br><br>
